Approach 1 has a function that creates a standard range loop that iterates 'n' times.
Each time it iterates, it multiples the range value by 2 and appends it to a list.
A for loop calls the function, iterates over the returned list, and prints the
numbers separated by colons.

Approach 2 uses a for loop and iterates over a list that is created using a expression with
a range function. The expression 'n * 2' multiples the values from the range function, which is
then added to the list. The for loop then iterates over the list and prints the
numbers separated by colons.

Approach 3 the function doubleG(n) is a generator function. Meaning it uses the yield keyword
instead of the return keyword. Regular functions usually instantly processes a return value
and then terminates. However, generator functions are lazy and produce the values in a iterable
one at a time whenever it is called. In this case, everytime the for loop calls the function 
doubleG(n), the range loop inside the function iterates only once and returns one value in
the list. This goes on until the for loop reaches it end step. One of the advantages of using
such a function is that it can be more memory efficient than creating a storing an entire list
all at once.
